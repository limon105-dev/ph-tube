      <p class="text-base">
        The scope of variables in JavaScript is determined by the keywords used to declare them: `var`, `let`, and
        `const`. The scope defines the region of the code where a variable can be accessed. Let's discuss the scope of
        each:</p>
      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">1. **var:** </span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            - Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, which means their scope is limited to the function in
            which
            they are declared.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - If a variable is declared using `var` outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and is
            accessible
            throughout the entire program.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - `var` does not have block scope, meaning it is not limited to the block (within curly braces) where it
            is
            defined. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. **let:**</span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            - Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block in which they are
            defined (inside curly braces).
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - `let` allows you to create variables that are confined to a specific block, statement, or expression.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - It does not get hoisted to the top of its block like `var`.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. **const:**</span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            - Variables declared with `const` also have block scope..
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - `const` is used to declare constants, and its value cannot be reassigned once it is assigned.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - Like `let`, `const` does not get hoisted to the top of its block.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        In summary, `var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped. Using `let` and `const` is generally
        preferred over `var` because it helps prevent unintended variable redeclarations and provides better control
        over variable scoping. Additionally, `const` is useful when you want to declare constants that should not be
        reassigned.

      <p class="text-base">
        null and undefined are both special values in JavaScript, but they are used in different contexts.
      </p>
      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">1. **null:** </span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            - The null value is explicitly assigned by the programmer to indicate the absence of any object value or a
            variable intentionally having no value.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - It is often used to represent a deliberate non-existence or an empty value.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - null is commonly used when you want to explicitly say that a variable or an object property should have no
            value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. **undefined:**</span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            - The undefined value in JavaScript is the default value assigned to a variable that has been declared but
            not yet assigned a value.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - It is also the default return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - Variables that are declared but not initialized are undefined.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            - undefined is often a signal that something might not be initialized or that a value is missing.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="py-3">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-3 underline">Use Cases:</h3>
          <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">1.null Use Cases: </span>
          <ul class="py-3">
            <li class="py-2">
              - Explicitly setting a variable or object property to indicate the absence of a value.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
              - It can be used in comparisons to check if a variable intentionally holds no value.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="py-3">
          <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">2.undefined Use Cases:</span>
          <ul class="py-3">
            <li class="py-2">
              - Default value for function parameters when no argument is passed.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
              - Default value for variables that might be initialized later.
            </li>
            <li class="py-2">
              - As the default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        In practice, null and undefined are often used in different scenarios, but developers need to be mindful of
        their meanings and use them appropriately to avoid unintended issues in the code.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium pb-4 underline">*REST API:</h3>
      <p class="text-base">
        REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an
        architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is not a protocol, but a set of principles or
        constraints that define how web standards, such as HTTP and URLs, should be used.
      </p>
      <div class="py-3">
        <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Key principles of REST include:</span>
        <ul class="py-3">
          <li class="py-2">
            1. Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to
            understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state
            between requests. This makes the system more scalable and easier to maintain.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            2. Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate entities that communicate over a network.
            The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for
            processing requests, managing resources, and handling business logic.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            3. Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs should have a consistent and uniform interface, making it easy for
            clients to understand and interact with the API. This is achieved through the following constraints:
            <ul class="py-3">
              <li class="py-2">
                > Resource Identification: Resources (such as data objects or services) are identified by URIs (Uniform
                Resource Identifiers).
              </li>
              <li class="py-2">
                > Resource Manipulation through Representations: Resources can be manipulated by representing their
                state in a format, typically JSON or XML, and sending it between the client and server.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            4. Stateless Communication: Each request from a client to a server should contain all the information needed
            to understand and fulfill the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state
            between requests.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            5. Cacheability: Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable. This
            allows clients to reuse responses and reduce the load on the server.
          </li>
          <li class="py-2">
            6. Layered System: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer providing a specific
            set of functionality. Each layer should only be aware of the layer immediately beneath it and should not be
            concerned with the implementation details of higher layers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        RESTful APIs are commonly used in web development to enable communication between different systems or services
        over the internet. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources,
        and data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML format. RESTful APIs are widely adopted due to their simplicity,
        scalability, and ease of use.
